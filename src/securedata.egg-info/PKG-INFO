# SecureData

A library that allows for easy reading/writing of settings across repositories, as well as mail and logging.

## Author

- Tyler Woodfin
  - [GitHub](https://www.github.com/tylerjwoodfin)
  - [Website](http://tyler.cloud)

## Features

- Get/Set data within a JSON file in the location of your choice
- Using rclone, automatically sync to/from directories as needed
- Log to a file/directory of your choice without having to configure `logger` each time
- Send/receive mail

## Structure

- Data is stored in `settings.json` (in `~/securedata` by default)
- Logs are written to `~/securedata/log` by default

## Installation and Setup

```bash
  python3 -m pip install securedata
```

### editFile

- see example below
- You can also call `/path/to/securedata.py edit {filepath or shortcut}`

### mail

- It is NEVER a good idea to store your password in plaintext; for this reason, I strongly recommend a "throwaway" account that is only used for sending emails
- Gmail (as of May 2022) and most other mainstream email providers won't work with this; for support, search for sending mail from your email provider with `smtplib`.
- In `settings.json`, add the `email` object to make your settings file look like this example:

```
{
    "email": {
        "from": "throwaway@example.com",
        "from_pw": "example",
        "from_name": "Raspberry Pi",
        "to": "destination@protonmail.com",
        "smtp_server": "example.com",
        "imap_server": "example.com",
        "port": 123
    }
}
```

### Configuration

- To choose where `settings.json` is stored, use

```
securedata config
```

- To choose where logs will be stored, edit `settings.json` and set `path -> log` to the full path to the log folder. (in other words, `{"path": "log": "/path/to/folder"})

## Examples

### `setItem`

```
from securedata import securedata

securedata.setItem("employee", "Tyler", "salary", 7.25)
```

results in this structure in settings.json:

```
{
    "employee": {
        "Tyler": {
            "salary": 7.25
        }
    }
}
```

### `getItem`

```
from securedata import securedata

print(securedata.getItem("employee", "Tyler", "salary")) # given example settings.json above
```

```
> python3 test.py
> 7.25
```

### `editFile`

```
from securedata import securedata

# if setItem("path", "edit", "shopping", "/path/to/shopping.md") has been called, this will edit the file
# assigned to that shortcut.

# opens file in Vim, saves upon exit
securedata.editFile("shopping")

# or you can edit a file directly...
securedata.editFile("/path/to/shopping.md")

# set path -> edit -> sync-pull and path -> edit -> sync-push to specify commands that should be run for cloud integration.
```

### `mail`

```

from securedata import mail

mail.send('Test Subject', 'Test Body')

```

### `log`

```

from securedata import securedata

# writes to a file named LOG_DAILY YYYY-MM-DD in the default log folder (or securedata.getItem('path', 'log')) inside a YYYY-MM-DD folder

securedata.log("Dear Diary...")
securedata.log("This function hit a breakpoint", level="debug")
securedata.log("Looks like the server is on fire", level="critical")
securedata.log("This is fine", level="info")

# writes to a file named LOG_TEMPERATURE

securedata.log("30", logName="LOG_TEMPERATURE")

# writes to a file named LOG_TEMPERATURE in /home/pi/weather

securedata.log("30", logName="LOG_TEMPERATURE", filePath="/home/pi/weather")

    # format
    # 2021-12-29 19:29:27,896 — INFO — 30

```

## Dependencies

- Python >= 3.6
- [Rclone](https://rclone.org)
  - optional, used to sync data to/from cloud providers
  - support for customizing this with `securedata.config` in a future update

## Disclaimers

- Although I've done quite a bit of testing, I can't guarantee everything that works on my machine will work on yours. Always back up your data to multiple places to avoid data loss.
- If you find any issues, please contact me... or get your hands dirty and raise a PR!
